# AlgoFlow 

**Master algorithms visually.**

AlgoFlow is an AI-powered coding companion that instantly transforms your code into interactive flowcharts. Designed for students, developers, and visual learners, it bridges the gap between abstract logic and clear understanding.

## What is AlgoFlow?

Writing code is easy; understanding complex logic is hard. AlgoFlow takes your Python or JavaScript code and uses Gemini AI to generate a step-by-step visual representation of how your algorithm runs.

Stop tracing loops in your head—see them on the screen.

## Key Features

* **⚡ Instant Visualization:** Type code on the left, see the logic flow on the right.
* **🤖 AI-Powered Analysis:** Uses Google Gemini to understand complex logic, loops, and recursions.
* **⏱️ Complexity Insights:** Automatically calculates the Time (Big O) and Space complexity of your solution.
* **🎨 Interactive Flowcharts:** Zoom, pan, and explore your algorithm's structure.

## How It Works

1.  **Write Code:** Enter your algorithm in the editor (supports Python & JS).
2.  **Visualize:** Click the generate button.
3.  **Learn:** Watch as your logic is mapped out into a clear, connected flowchart.
